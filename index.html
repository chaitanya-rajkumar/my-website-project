  <h3 class="display-6" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 10px; font-style: italic; font-style: oblique;">Red Bull vs Ferrari – who's favourite to deliver at Imola?</h3>
  <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 10px">
    Mark Hughes weighs up the strengths of Ferrari and Red Bull to see which of the championship-contending teams is best placed to ace the upcoming Emilia Romagna Grand Prix weekend.

<p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">Despite what the current reliability-skewed championship points suggest, the two fastest cars are currently the Ferrari F1-75 and Red Bull RB18. The Ferrari appears to have the edge overall but the Red Bull has so far shown an advantage in end-of-straight speeds. The longer the flat-out top gear stretches of a circuit are, the more valuable that Red Bull trait is – and it’s probably not a coincidence that Red Bull’s only pole and victory so far came on the super high-speed Jeddah Corniche Circuit. The Ferrari’s advantage so far has tended to be in low-speed corners and acceleration. The upcoming Imola track has an extended high-speed section (Sector 1) followed by a sequence of downforce and acceleration-rewarding corners linked by relatively short straights.</p>
<p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;"><p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;">The margins are small enough that any differences in the quality of the respective drivers’ laps could overcome it, but the suggestion so far is that the Ferrari is faster over a wider variety of layouts.</p>
<p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;"><p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;">Looking at Imola, the first sector (from the start/finish to the braking zone for Tosa) is a very long flat-out blast punctuated by two chicanes. Based on what we’ve seen so far that looks likely to be Red Bull’s best sector. The frequent acceleration and power-rewarding sections (notably up the hill out of Acque Minerale) of the remainder of the lap look as if they could have been made for the Ferrari.</p>

    Ferrari are leading both championships ahead of their return home to Imola, and Mark Hughes explains the turnaround and how team has grown in adversity

<p max-width="800" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">This time around Ferrari appear to be built on more secure foundations. Operationally they have looked much slicker in the last season or so than during the Vettel era. They have a more settled, less schizophrenic ambience with Mattia Binotto providing a calmer leadership than Maurizio Arrivabene back then.</p>
<p max-width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;"><p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;">Ferrari have followed a very individualistic technical path with this car - which they had done also in 2017 and '18 - and have had the perfect preparation in that they did not need to worry about compromising the 2021 season in order to fully prepare for this year. The '21 car was not in any way a title contender and the emphasis since the beginning of 2020 has always been upon maximising the new regulations (originally set for '21, later postponed to '22).</p>
<p max-width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;"><p width="800" style="margin-left: 10px;">The F1-75 seemingly has a wider range of corner types on which it works than the rival Red Bull, and GPS analysis suggests its power unit is the best of all, something reflected in the relatively strong form of the Ferrari-engined customer teams Alfa Romeo and Haas. As such, Leclerc has made himself very much the championship favourite even so early in the season. Carlos Sainz struggled a little for pace in comparison in the first two races and then had his Melbourne weekend ruined by a series of technical glitches, so giving Leclerc the clear initiative in the points table. The Leclerc-Binotto relationship is a more serene one than Vettel-Arrivabene which was quite troubled beneath the surface, with two diametrically opposed temperaments and philosophies.</p>
